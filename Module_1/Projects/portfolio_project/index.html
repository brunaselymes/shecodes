                        <p class="about-me-text">
                            Nice to meet you, I'm Bruna. I am originally from Sao Paulo - Brazil, but I've been living in Brisbane - Australia since 2016 and loving it.</p>
                            <p class="about-me-text">In 2011 started uni, I studied Systems Development and graduated in 2014, but I never had a coding job before, I have always worked for IT companies though.
                            When I decided to move countries I also had to start my career from scratch, I worked as a Barista, then for a long time I was part of the customer service team at a wholesaler.</p> 
                            <p class="about-me-text">In 2020 when the world changed, I decided to change as well, I realised it was about time to get back on track and study again, get a job in tech and
                            follow my passion. This was my main goal for 2020/2021 and I finally got my first job as a support developer in April 2021, in parallel I also got lucky enough to be accepted into
                            the She Codes Plus program, a program dedicated to help women to get into tech careers.

                            I'm a big fan of Youtube and also love TV series (love a good Netflix and chill vibe). </p><p class="about-me-text"> LOVE travelling and hope we'll be allowed to do this again very soon, so I can tick a few more places
                            of my list. </p><p class="about-me-text">I also found a new hobby: cooking everything from scratch and eating my creations, specially after adopting a plant-based lifestyle I've been having so much fun exploring
                            this world.</p>
